<p>
The <strong>TimeCompareWidget</strong> from the &quot;Ecclestone TV&quot; Widgets Set displays the
last three laptimes and compares them to the ones of the next car in front or behind.
</p>

<p>
Times are compared to the car (next in front or behind) being closer to you. You can influence this decision
with the <strong>preferNextInFront</strong> property. To make an early decision, the gap to next behind
at the beginning of sector 3 is compared to the gap to next in front at S/F line.
</p>

<p>
This Widget is only displayed every few laps depending on the <strong>displayEveryXLaps</strong> property.
When you pass the S/F line and the car next in front is closer than the car next behind, the Widget is
displayed immediately. If next behind is closer, it is displayed when that car crosses the S/F line.
</p>

<p>
The Widget is displayed for the amount of seconds defined in the <strong>visibleTime</strong> property.
All the rest of the time this Widget is invisible.
