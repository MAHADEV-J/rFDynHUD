<p>
The <strong>StandingsWidget</strong> from the &quot;Ecclestone TV&quot; Widgets Set displays the list of drivers and gaps.
</p>

<p>
In non-race sessions the items are displayed, only if the driver has a valid timed lap. Then the item will be displayed till
the end of the session.
</p>

<p>
I the race session the Widget will only show up when the cars near you cross the S/F line.
