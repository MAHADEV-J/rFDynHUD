The <strong>ETVTelemetryWidget</strong> renders a background image for the rev meter and velocity gauge and
a gear display and a dynamic needle on top of it. Additionally it has a throttle and brake display.
You can freely define the positions of the elements on the Widget. And you can customize the rev markers.
