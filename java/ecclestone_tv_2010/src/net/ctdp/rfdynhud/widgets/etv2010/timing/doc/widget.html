<p>
The <strong>SessionStateWidget</strong> from the &quot;Ecclestone TV&quot; Widgets Set displays the
current state of the session. For timed sessions this is the remaining session time and for lap-limited
races this is the current lap (or completed laps) and the total number of laps.
</p>

<p>
This Widget is invisible most of the time. It is only displayed when you come close to the next sector boundary
and some seconds after you crossed it. If nobody has yet driven a timed lap, the Widget is displayed only at the
end of your first flying lap. These decisions can be influenced resp. overruled though the <strong>visibleTimeAfterSector</strong>,
<strong>visibleTimeBeforeSector</strong> and <strong>alwaysVisible</strong> properties.
