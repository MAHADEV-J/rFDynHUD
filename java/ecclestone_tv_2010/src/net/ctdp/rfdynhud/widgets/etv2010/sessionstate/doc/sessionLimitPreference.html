<p>
The <strong>sessionLimitPreference</strong> property defines the prefered way, a session is limited.

<p>
The Widget tries to autodetect the session limit (laps or time). If a session seems to be both lap limited
and time limited and none of them limits significantly rigorously, this property is used.
