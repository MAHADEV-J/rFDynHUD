<p>
The <strong>visibleIf</strong> property denotes the name of the Widget, that needs to be visible
for this Widget to be visible, too.
</p>

<p>
If the given name is empty or no Widget by the given name exists in the current configuration,
this ImageWidget will always be visible (except if hidden by input binding of course).
