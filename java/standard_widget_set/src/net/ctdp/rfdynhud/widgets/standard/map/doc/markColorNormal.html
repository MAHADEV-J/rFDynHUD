The <strong>markColorNormal</strong> property defines the color to use for all cars, but special ones.

Special cars are e.g. the leader's car, the next in front, your own car or the next behind.

Like any color value this property can contain a concrete color definition or a color name.
Using a named color can be useful to theme your widget configuration.
