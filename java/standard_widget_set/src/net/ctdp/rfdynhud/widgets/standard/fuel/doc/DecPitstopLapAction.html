The <strong>DecPitstopLapAction</strong> shifts the planned lap for the next stop to one lap earlier.
</p>

<p>
The value is of course limited to the current lap.
So if you decrement it to the minimum, you can stop at the end of the current lap
and the fuel for the next pit stop will be incremented, so that the next-next stop will be as planned.
