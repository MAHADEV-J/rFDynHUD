<p>
The <strong>swapTireWearGripMeaning</strong> property tells, whether to swap the meaning
of the tire wear bar and line.
</p>

<p>
Unswappeed (default) the bar displays the grip, which is the actually important value
and the line displays the wear.<br />
Swapped it's the other way round.
