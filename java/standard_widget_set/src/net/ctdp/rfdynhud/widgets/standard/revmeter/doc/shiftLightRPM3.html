<p>
The <strong>shiftLightRPM</strong> property defines the refs, above which the shift light is on.
</p>

<p>
The given value is not the concrete RPM, but a negative number, that is added to the current maximum RPM.
</p>

<p>
If the current (boost dependent) max RPM is 20000 and the value of shiftLightRPM is -500,
the shift light will be activated at refs at and above 19500 RPM.
