<p>
The <strong>hundredPercentBase</strong> property defines the range to be used as a base to compute 100% engine health.
</p>

<p>
By default this is SAFE_RANGE which only displays positive percentages while the engine health is in the range, where it will never fail.
Negative values denote risk (engine could fail).
</p>

<p>
If you don't want the value to become negative at any time, set this to MAX_RANGE.
</p>

<p>
This property won't have any effect, if your engine doesn't have any variance in lifetime.
