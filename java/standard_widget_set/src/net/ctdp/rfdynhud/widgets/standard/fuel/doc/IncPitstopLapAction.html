The <strong>IncPitstopLapAction</strong> InputAction shifts the planned lap for the next stop to one lap later.
</p>

<p>
The new lap is limited by the current fuel load.
So if you increment it to the maximum,
only a small amount of fuel will be left in the tank when you serve your next pitstop.
