If the <strong>roundUpRemainingLaps</strong> property is activated, the remaining
fuel laps display displays the value from the beginning of the lap for the whole lap.

Using this flag makes it a lot easier to tell, how many laps of fuel are remaining.
You don't have to calculate that on your own. We highly encourage you to use this flag.
It is only not enabled by default, because it might be confusing for some people.
