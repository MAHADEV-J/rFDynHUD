The <strong>engineEstimationImage</strong> property defines the image to be drawn at the place
in the lifetime bar, that is estimated for the engine to have at the end of the race.

If your engine has a lifetime variance, the engine might fail before.

<p>
The estimation math uses the wear of the last lap and projects it on the rest of the race.
