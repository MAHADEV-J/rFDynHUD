<p>
The <strong>forceCurrentCumulSectors</strong> property tells, whether the second sector of the
current lap is displayed as a sum of the first sector and the (partially driven) second sector,
even if the <strong>cumulativeSectors</strong> property is false. 
</p>

<p>
If this setting is true, the third sector will be displayed like the second one.
If the setting is false, the third sector is hidden.
