The <strong>FuelWidget</strong> displays extended and autocomputed fuel information.
</p>

<p>
It displays the fuel usage for the last lap, the average fuel usage per lap for the current stint
and autocomputes the needed fuel load for the next pitstop.
</p>

<p>
You can manipulate the precalculations by using the attached InputActions.
Use the editor's input bindings manager to define appropriate input bindings.
The increment action without holding the SHIFT key shifts the planned lap for the next stop.
With holding the SHIFT key, the number of fuel laps is incremented.
The same is for the decrement action.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to adjust the actual fuel setting on the pitboard. We cannot do this for you due to rFactor limitations.
