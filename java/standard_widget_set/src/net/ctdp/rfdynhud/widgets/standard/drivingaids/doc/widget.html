<p>
The <strong>DrivingAidsWidget</strong> displays an icon for each available driving aid showing it's current state.
</p>
<p>
You can hide certain aids by setting the state visibility to "Never".
</p>
<p>
By setting the state visibility to something like "If not Off", the aid icon is only displayed,
if it's current state doesn't equal "Off". A hidden icon will not reserve it's place, so suceeding
aid icons in the order will take this place.
