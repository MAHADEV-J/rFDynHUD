The <strong>WearWidget</strong> renders wear/health information.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Engine</u></strong><br />
The engine lifetime (wear/health) is displayed both as a bar and as a percentage value.
<ul>
    <li>
        The normal green (right most) part of the bar is the safe lifetime range. The engine will (or should) never fail within that range.
        When the normal green part has gone, the percentage value will show 0.0% (please see the &quot;hundredPercentBase&quot; property).
    </li>
    <li>
        If the engine has a lifetime variance (random range), it is displayed as the non-normal-green part of the bar.<br />
        This is:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A light green part: The engine should only fail here in rare cases. Normally it lasts beyond this range.
            </li>
            <li>
                A yellow part: The engine will fail somewhere within that range in most cases.
            </li>
            <li>
                And a red part: The engine will fail here in rare cases only.
            </li>
        </ul>
        While the bar is within the variance parts the percentage value will become negative.
    </li>
</ul>
Make sure to properly map engine boost buttons in the InputbindingsManager. Otherwise engine health will not be calculated correctly
when changing the boost level in cockpit.

<strong><u>Tires</u></strong><br />
The upper value is the absolute wear. The lower value (in parentheses)
is the grip in percent and the bar shows the normalized grip.
The red line in the bar shows the wear again.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Brakes</u></strong><br />
The brake bars show a green and red part again. This has the same meaning as for the engine.
