The <strong>IncPitstopFuelAction</strong> InputAction increments the fuel load (in laps) for the next pit stop.

The new value is limited by the tank size and race length (if in a race session).
So if you increment it to the maximum, you will either drive with a full tank
or to the end of the race.
