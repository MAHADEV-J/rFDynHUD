<p>
The <strong>numShiftLights</strong> property defines the number of displayed shift lights (min: 0, max: 5).

<p>
The on-state shift light is taken from the given on-image. The off-state shift light is either taken from the background image at the given location,
if the off-image is nothing, or taken from the given off-image.
If the off-image is taken from the background image, the rectangle is completely replaced by the on-state image, if the state is on. So make sure, the surrounding pixels match.
