<p>
The <strong>throttleImage</strong> property defines the image file name to use for the throttle bar.

<p>
If this is NOT set to no-image, it will override the color property.

The image must contain both the background and the dynamic bar image.<br />
If the bar is drawn vertically (default), the background is taken from the left half of the image
and the dynamic bar from the right half.<br />
If the bar is drawn horizontally, the background is taken from the upper half of the image
and the dynamic bar from the lower half.<br />
