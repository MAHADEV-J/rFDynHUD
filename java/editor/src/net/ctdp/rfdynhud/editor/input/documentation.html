<strong>General</strong><br />
The <i>InputBindingsManager</i> serves to define key and button mappings to <i>InputAction</i>s.
</p>

<p>
An InputAction is either global and applicable to all Widget types or even the whole plugin or it is
specific to a certain Widget type. It should be fairly simple to see, which actions belong to a certain
Widget type and which are global ones. Widget specific actions won't allow for typing a Widget name in the
first column and will display an uneditable &quot;GLOBAL&quot; in that cell. Always read the Widgets'
documentations to know better about this.
</p>

<p>
A non-global <i>InputAction</i> is triggered on a Widget in the currently active configuration. For example
if you map a button on your steering wheel to the <i>ToggleWidgetVisibility</i> action, it is triggered on the
Widget identified by the name denoted under the &quot;Widget Name&quot; column. If the current configuration
contains a Widget with that name, this Widget's visibility is toggled when the button is pressed. If the
current configuration doesn't know a Widget by that name, nothing happens.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Reusability across configurations</strong><br />
If there is a mapping to an <i>InputAction</i> on a Widget called &quot;MyWidget&quot;, this mapping affects
all Widgets by that name in all configurations. So all these mappings are not private to the currently loaded
configuration, but apply to any configuration, that is loaded in-game.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Creating a new mapping</strong><br />
To create a new mapping you just have to either type a Widget's name in the left-most cell of the last row,
or select an action in that row.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mapping a key or button</strong><br />
To do this simply doubleclick the third cell in the row to be modified. The cell's contents will change to
&quot;[Press a key or button]&quot;. Do, what you're told and you're through.<br />
As of rfDynHUD v1.1.0 you can even define key combinations like CTRL+H simply by pressing that combination.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Removing a mapping</strong><br />
Either set the Widget name to an empty string or set the <i>InputAction</i> to &quot;[No Action]&quot;
and the mapping will not be saved and will have disappeared when you next enter the <i>InputBindingsManager</i>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Double mappings</strong><br />
It is possible to map one key or button to more than one <i>InputAction</i>. This is important for two reasons.<br />
1. You might want to trigger more than one action at a time by that key or button.<br />
2. You may want to do one thing in one configuration and something else in another configuration.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Hit Times</strong><br />
When you set this value to 3 for a given binding, the key or button has to be hit 3 times within a second to trigger
this action.
