The <strong>peakNeedleImageName</strong> property defines the image to be used to display the peak needle.
</p>

<p>
For best visual results the width should be even.
</p>

<p>
Set this image to no-image to disable the peak needle.
</p>

<p>
The peak needle will always be rendered last, but before the main needle.
