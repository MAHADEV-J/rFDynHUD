<p>
The <strong>x</strong> property defines the x coordinate of the Widget.
</p>

<p>
If the <strong>positioning</strong> property is set to TOP_LEFT, CENTER_LEFT or BOTTOM_LEFT,
the x-coordinate is the distance of the Widget's left edge to the left border of the screen.
</p>

<p>
If the <strong>positioning</strong> property is set to TOP_CENTER, CENTER_CENTER or BOTTOM_CENTER,
the x-coordinate is the distance of the Widget's horizontal center to the screen's horizontal center.
</p>

<p>
If the <strong>positioning</strong> property is set to TOP_RIGHT, CENTER_RIGHT or BOTTOM_RIGHT,
the x-coordinate is the distance of the Widget's right edge to the right border of the screen.
</p>

<p>
The x property can be given in absolute pixels or in percent.
+100% don't mean the total screen width, but total screen height * 4 / 3 to avoid scaling problems between 4:3er and 16:10er resolutions.
Use the opposite positioning to achieve this. The editor will do this automatically when dragging with the mouse.
Hence the value could have these forms:
<ul>
    <li>123</li>
    <li>34%</li>
    <li><s>110%</s></li>
    <li>67.357%</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Click the &quot;px&quot; or &quot;%&quot; button to convert between
pixels and percent (preserving the absolute value).
