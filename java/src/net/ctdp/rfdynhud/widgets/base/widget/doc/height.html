<p>
The <strong>height</strong> property defines the Widget's height.
</p>

<p>
If the value is positive, it simply defines the Widget's height.<br />
If the value is negative, the Widget's height is defined by (resolution_y - abs(height)).<br />
Click the &quot;flip&quot; button to switch between these two modes.
</p>

<p>
The height property can be given in absolute pixels or in percent and can be negative or positive.
Hence the value could have these forms:
<ul>
    <li>123</li>
    <li>-20</li>
    <li>34%</li>
    <li>-12%</li>
    <li>67.357%</li>
    <li>-27.96%</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Click the &quot;flip&quot; button to convert between positive and negative representation (preserving
the absolute value) and click the &quot;px&quot; or &quot;%&quot; button to convert between
pixels and percent (preserving the absolute value).
